# Project identity

### What does AerynOS mean and how do I pronounce it?

AerynOS is a stylized spelling of "Erin", alluding to the project's Irish roots. It is pronounced exactly the same as "Erin" - "AIR-in" OS. It's also a play on "aer" and the phonetic "air" sound, indicative of our desire to produce an open, trusted and high-performance operating system.

It's pronounced as "AIR-in" OS.

### What was Serpent OS?

Serpent OS is the former name of AerynOS. We [announced our rebrand](https://aerynos.com/blog/2025/02/14/evolve-this-os/) back in February 2025, which culminated with the inaugural release of AerynOS 2025.03 on March 25th, 2025. Per the announcement, our desire to rebrand was chiefly driven due to effectively being lumbered with a hastily chosen name, that poorly reflected the project's goals and aspirations.

The project itself remains the same, with the same goals and aspirations, but with a new name and a fresh coat of paint.

# Usage Questions

### Why don't application icons for newly installed apps show up in my current session after a sync or install?

It is a known issue and we are working on a solution.

For now, log out and back in again and they will show up.

### When do I need to reboot after updates?

- Kernel updates require a reboot.
- Some updates require you to log out of your desktop session and back in (see above).
- Most updates only require you to close the apps that were updated and start them again.

### How do I configure custom kernel command line parameters applied at each boot?

See the [blsforme repo readme](https://github.com/AerynOS/blsforme/?tab=readme-ov-file#filesystem-layout) for the expected format.

Typically, it is necessary to change the installed system state with `moss` for command-line snippets to take effect.

One way of doing that is to do a `sudo moss remove nano -y && sudo moss install nano -y`, followed by `sudo moss boot status` to check if the new cmdline snippet is now active.

# Package Questions

### How come your package repository is so small?

We are still in heavy development ("Alpha") and are developing our backend and associated automated rebuild processes.

If we discover that it is necessary for us to rebuild our entire repository, we would like the ability to do so in the span of an afternoon (using multiple builders in parallel).

Once our backend story and our automated rebuild process story are both further advanced, we will begin scaling out the repository to contain more packages.

### Could you package (...) please?

See above.

For now, we encourage users to use flatpaks for the applications we do not yet carry in our repository.

Currently, we are focusing on adding must-have packages for platform bring-up, for things that give us a development edge, or for things that help us showcase AerynOS capabilities.

If the use-case for the package you are proposing is in line with the ethos above, you can make a package request [here](https://github.com/AerynOS/recipes/issues/new/choose)

### Where can I learn how to package for AerynOS?

Consult the packaging documentation [here](/packaging/).

In addition, consult the AerynOS [recipes/ repository](https://github.com/AerynOS/recipes).

Finally, join the [AerynOS Zulip space](https://aerynos.zulipchat.com/join/fuqokhsomj5mzqj6akqaiqlr/) and make sure to join the #Onboarding channel in the General - Public space.

# Project Questions

### Which distribution is AerynOS derived from?

AerynOS has been bootstrapped and built from scratch and is not based on any other distro.

This implies that AerynOS has its own:

- package manager (`moss`)
- package build tool (`boulder`)
- build pipeline consisting of:
  - the package build dashboard and controller (`summit`)
  - the builder-as-a-service middleware (`avalanche`)
  - the package repository manager (`vessel`)

This also implies that AerynOS does NOT build upon or use either:

- `.rpm` related tooling from Red Hat
- `.deb` related tooling from the Debian Project
- Arch-related tooling

### When will AerynOS be considered stable?

AerynOS is taking on the ambitious task of creating a distribution from scratch, whilst building its own tooling and solutions for this.

As such, there is no official ETA.

Now that the project has hit alpha status, you will see frequent updates and progress reports.
