# Installation Questions

### Which CPUs does AerynOS support?

AerynOS is currently only compiled for the x86-64-v2 target architecture, which means that it will run on CPUs supporting x86-64-v2 or greater psABI feature levels.

Checking the currently supported x86-64 psABI feature level of a system can be done by typing the following command in a terminal as a normal user:

```
/usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep "x86-64"
```

On an x86-64-v2 based system, you will see the following output:

```
Usage: /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 [OPTION]... EXECUTABLE-FILE [ARGS-FOR-PROGRAM...]
This program interpreter self-identifies as: /usr/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
  x86-64-v4
  x86-64-v3
  x86-64-v2 (supported, searched)
```

<Aside type="note">
    If the x86-64-v3 and x86-64-v4 psABI feature levels were supported, they would also show `(supported, searched)` next to them. AerynOS will still work on these systems.

### Does AerynOS offer NVIDIA GPU support?

Due to the way NVIDIA distributes its drivers, maintaining them in a distro is labor-intensive and frustrating when they do not work as advertised.

Given AerynOS is in the Alpha development stage, only limited, best effort NVIDIA enablement related to cards supported by the so-called nvidia-open-gpu-kernel-modules is currently offered.

You can check the status of NVIDIA support in [AerynOS/recipes#435](https://github.com/AerynOS/recipes/issues/435)

### Does AerynOS support being installed alongside another OS?

Officially? Not yet.

You can try, but there is no guarantee that AerynOS won't eat your other OS.

You have been warned.

### What is the recommended partition layout for AerynOS?

In practice, we recommend that you install AerynOS to a separate drive with:

- A >=256MB ESP FAT32 partition (type 1 in fdisk).
  -   This must be manually formatted for the installer to recognize it.
- A 4GB XBOOTLDR FAT32 partition (type 142 in fdisk, bls_boot in gparted).
  - This must be manually formatted for the installer to recognize it.
  - This partition is large, because it is where the AerynOS kernel+initramfs and (in the future) rescue image files will be saved.
- A >20 GB system xfs partition
  - This must be manually formatted for the installer to recognize it.
  - The larger the xfs system (/ or root) partition is, the more OS /usr directory rollback states it can support in /.moss/.

NB: Remember, there is nothing stopping you from creating an extra partition, formatting it with a filesystem of your choice, and then configuring /etc/fstab to mount it as /home after AerynOS has been installed. You can do this if you want to use a different filesystem than xfs for your /home folders for whatever reason.
