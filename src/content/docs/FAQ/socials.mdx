# Social engagement

### Is it ok to share links to video content of AerynOS in action in the Zulip rooms?

Yes! We absolutely love seeing people using AerynOS in the wild!

- Please first share them as a post in the [Show and Tell category](https://github.com/orgs/AerynOS/discussions/categories/show-and-tell),
- Then, share a link to your post in the [AerynOS Zulip space](https://aerynos.zulipchat.com/join/fuqokhsomj5mzqj6akqaiqlr/) in the #Show-and-Tell channel in the General - Public space so the link to the video doesn't get lost in the Zulip chat.

### Why don't you have a Discord server?

AerynOS is an open-source project that values transparency, collaboration, and community engagement. When looking at Discord, it is a closed-source platform that we believe **has different priorities**, specifically around monetization and data collection.

To this end, AerynOS would much rather promote the use of an open-source community platform such as Zulip. In the time we have been using Zulip, we have been very happy with the platform and how it has enabled us to build a strong and engaged community.
