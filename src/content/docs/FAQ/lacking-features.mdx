# What features are missing?

### Secure Boot

Secure Boot is a UEFI firmware security feature that ensures only digitally signed, trusted software, such as operating system loaders and drivers, can run during the startup process. This prevents malicious rootkits or an unauthorized OS from loading. It is a mandatory requirement for Windows 11 and is looked for as an additional security feature on Linux distributions.

The AerynOS project is committed to providing Secure Boot support for its users in the future. However, this will come further down the line.

### Dual booting from the same drive

Officially, this is not yet supported when running AerynOS. We know of some more experienced users who have successfully installed AerynOS alongside other operating systems however this is done at their own risk.

Our tooling is currently developed purely for making sure AerynOS is installed correctly and makes no consideration for other operating systems. As such, we highly recommend users avoid trying to dual boot with another OS from the same drive.

If you have multiple drives in your system, you could dedicate one drive to AerynOS and another to your other OS.

### Disk encryption

Disk encryption is a security feature that encrypts the data on a hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD) to protect it from unauthorized access. This is done by using a key to encrypt the data before it is written to the drive and decrypting it when it is read.

The AerynOS project is committed to providing disk encryption support for its users in the future. However, this will come further down the line.
