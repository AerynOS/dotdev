## Downloading the ISO

1. Visit the [AerynOS download page](https://aerynos.com/download/).
2. Use the direct download or bittorrent option to get the latest release.
3. Download the checksum file

## Verifying the Checksums

Before creating a bootable USB drive, it's important to verify the checksums to ensure the integrity of the downloaded ISO file.

<Aside type="tip">
    AerynOS utilizes a GNOME based live environment for installation. Our installer `lichen` is a netinstaller that can be used to install GNOME, KDE Plasma, Cosmic or a terminal-only environment based on your requirements.

### Linux

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the ISO file is located along with the checksums.

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```

2. Run the following command to verify the checksums:

```bash
sha256sum -c <checksum_file>
```
You should see a message indicating that the checksums match if the ISO file is valid.

```bash
AerynOS-2026.01-GNOME-live-x86_64.iso: OK
```

If the checksums do not match, download the ISO file again and repeat the verification process.

### Windows

1. Open a Command Prompt window and navigate to the directory where the ISO file is located along with the checksums.

```cmd
cd C:\Users\<username>\Downloads
```

2. Run the following command to verify the checksums:

```cmd
certutil -hashfile aerynos-<version>.iso SHA256
```

This will give you the checksum of the file, compare this to the checksum found inside the checksum file.
