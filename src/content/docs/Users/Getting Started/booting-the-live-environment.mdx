## Booting from a USB Drive

<Aside type="caution">
Currently NVIDIA Drivers are not implemented by the live environment and will fallback to nouveau drivers.
</Aside>

1. Insert the bootable USB drive into your system and boot from the USB drive.
2. Adjust or override your BIOS settings to boot from the USB drive.
3. You should see the AerynOS boot process, and you will be presented with the live environment.
4. **If utilizing Ventoy** select the AerynOS ISO file to boot from.

## Testing the Live Environment

<Aside type="tip">
For a representative experience, you will need to install AerynOS. The live environment will run slower than an installed system due to the limitations of running from a USB drive.
</Aside>

Once you have booted into the live environment, you can test AerynOS without installing it on your system.

- Explore the desktop environment.
- Test the pre-installed applications.
- Check the system performance.
- Verify the hardware compatibility.
- Connect to the internet and browse the web.
