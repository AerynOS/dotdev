The [COSMIC Desktop](https://system76.com/cosmic) from [System76](https://system76.org) is a highly popular
choice with AerynOS users. Despite early alpha status, it is notable for being written in Rust and using
a modern multiprocess architecture, while being Wayland-only. For many, this makes AerynOS and COSMIC an
ideal partnership.

### Installing COSMIC on AerynOS

AerynOS currently only offers one iso with a GNOME live environment. However, `lichen` is a net based installer that allows users to select their Desktop Environment at install time. As such, you can install AerynOS COSMIC edition directly from the GNOME based AerynOS installer iso.

If you already have a GNOME install and would like to try COSMIC, it is possible to install COSMIC on top of GNOME. This can be done by using the following command:

```bash
sudo moss install cosmic-desktop
```

### Controlling the display manager

If you've installed COSMIC over the top of a GNOME install, you can still log into your COSMIC session from `gdm`. You can also safely remove `gdm` and have `cosmic-greeter` take over. Note: GNOME Shell still expects `gdm` for full functionality.

#### Installing cosmic-greeter

```bash
sudo moss install cosmic-greeter
```

#### Removing gdm
If you wish to remove `gdm`, you would use the following command:

```bash
sudo moss remove gdm
```
