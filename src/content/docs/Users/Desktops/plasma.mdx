AerynOS now offers [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) as a Desktop Environment though it is currently considered beta staus. You can track the progress of identifying and resolving Plasma related issues on [Github](https://github.com/AerynOS/recipes/issues/952).

### Installing Plasma on an existing AerynOS install

If you are already using GNOME, you are able to install KDE Plasma side by side and select which Desktop Environment to use in `GDM` at login. You do this by installing one of three package sets:

```bash
sudo moss install pkgset-aeryn-plasma-minimal
sudo moss install pkgset-aeryn-plasma-recommended
sudo moss install pkgset-aeryn-plasma-full
```

The names are fairly self explanatory:
* Minimal: The minimum number of packages required for a Plasma desktop session
* Recommended: The Plasma desktop session plus additional recommended applications
* Full: The Plasma desktop session plus all available KDE applications


### Replacing GDM

You can log into a KDE Plasma session via `GDM` however you also have the option to install `SDDM` or `plasma-login-manager`

```bash
sudo moss install SDDM
```

or

```bash
sudo moss install plasma-login-manager
```
