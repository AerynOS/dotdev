description: Understand where packages ship their default configuration and how to override it on a stateless system.
---

AerynOS ships configuration in a stateless layout. Packages deliver defaults in `/usr/share/defaults`, while administrator and user changes live elsewhere so updates can proceed without overwriting your work.

## System defaults

Default files mirror the traditional `/etc` hierarchy under `/usr/share/defaults`.

| Purpose | Default location | Example contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base system settings | `/usr/share/defaults/etc` | `ld.so.conf`, `libnl`, `tpm2-tss` |
| PAM policies | `/usr/share/defaults/pam.d` | `sudo`, `system-login`, `polkit-1` |
| Shell profiles | `/usr/share/defaults/profile` and `/usr/share/defaults/profile.d` | `00-aeryn.sh`, interactive shell tweaks |
| Service defaults | `/usr/share/defaults/environment.d` | Session-wide environment snippets |
| Sudo configuration | `/usr/share/defaults/sudo` | `sudoers`, drop-in files |
| SSH defaults | `/usr/share/defaults/ssh` | `ssh_config`, `sshd_config` |


Packages may add more directories under `/usr/share/defaults` as required. The layout always mirrors where the file would appear under `/etc` on a traditional filesystem.

## System overrides

Place administrator overrides in `/etc`. Files in `/etc` shadow anything under `/usr/share/defaults` and survive package updates. Use drop-in directories such as `/etc/pam.d` or `/etc/sudoers.d` to keep customisations scoped and easy to audit.

When you need to revert to the shipped defaults, remove the override from `/etc` and Moss will fall back to the matching file in `/usr/share/defaults`.

## User-level configuration

Desktop and application settings follow the XDG Base Directory specification. Store per-user changes in:

- `~/.config` for configuration files
- `~/.local/share` for data files

These paths override both `/etc` and `/usr/share/defaults` for the owning user.

## Where to look next

Run the following command to explore the current defaults on your system:

```bash
ls /usr/share/defaults
```

Combine this with `moss search-file` to identify which package owns a specific default file when you need to adjust or report an issue.
