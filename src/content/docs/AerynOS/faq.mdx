## Project identity

<details>
    <summary>What does AerynOS mean and how do I pronounce it?</summary>

    AerynOS is a stylised spelling of "Erin", alluding to the project's Irish roots. It is pronounced
    exactly the same as "Erin" - "AIR-in" OS. It's also a play on "aer" and the phonetic "air" sound,
    indictive of our desire to produce an open, trusted and high-performance operating system.

    It's pronounced as "AIR-in" OS.

<details>
    <summary>What was Serpent OS?</summary>

    Serpent OS is the former name of AerynOS. We [announced our rebrand](https://aerynos.com/blog/2025/02/14/evolve-this-os/) back
    in February 2025, which culminated with the inaugural release of AerynOS 2025.03 on March 25th, 2025. Per the announcement,
    our desire to rebrand was chiefly driven due to effectively being lumbered with a hastily chosen name, that poorly reflected
    the project's goals and aspirations.

    The project itself remains the same, with the same goals and aspirations, but with a new name and a fresh coat of paint.
