AerynOS is a Linux-based operating system designed to eliminate years of technical baggage. It is an engineering
led effort in that the distribution is produced entirely by the tooling we have developed. Every new feature,
technology or enabling is carefully considered, drawing on our own experiences and by studying the impact in similar
decision spaces in other projects.

Despite being heavily engineering led, we are not averse to design. We aim to provide the best in class user experience
atop a solid, innovative foundation, whilst ensuring we have the scope and scalability to meet the needs of the future.

In essence, we're producing a distribution based on sound technical principles, in order to deliver a "daily driver"
that truly looks after itself, getting out of the way when you need it to, and providing the tools you need when you
need them.

If anything, AerynOS is "operating-system-as-infrastructure", providing a solid foundation for your daily computing
needs. We're not just a distribution, we're a platform for the future.

<Aside type="caution">
    Remember, AerynOS is still in development. Despite our goals, we must be clear
    that we've deemed ourselves to be alpha quality software.
