## Financial contributions to AerynOS

AerynOS is an independant effort run by a hand full of volunteers. The team is currently targeting an income of €500 per month to cover:

1. Infrastructure and project costs
2. Repayment to ermo for prior infra costs (he paid for and runs our builders)
3. Build up a buffer for unexpected costs and future initiatives.

We currently accept donations via [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/aerynos).

## Contributing to our websites (dotcom and dotdev)

AerynOS utilises GitHub to manage this docs site via [this repo](https://github.com/AerynOS/dotdev) and our main site via [this repo](https://github.com/AerynOS/dotcom) The readme of the repo provides the latest guidance on how to build a local version of the site. Our guidance is as follows:

1. Make a localy copy of the repo
2. Create an update branch and build the site locally
3. Make changes as appropriate and ensure those changes do not break the site
4. Once you are ready, submit a PR to the repo.

## Other contributions

The team are open to any other forms of contribution including any wallpapers or artwork that you may submit.
