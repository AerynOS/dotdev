Once the [prerequisites](../prerequisites) have been handled, it is time to learn how to install
newly built local moss-format `.stone` packages.


## Understanding moss-format repositories

When building and testing packages locally, boulder (and moss) can be configured to consult a local
moss-format repository containing moss-format `.stone` packages and a `stone.index` local repository
index.

### `stone.index` files

The `stone.index` file is what both moss and boulder consult when they check which packages are
available to be installed into moss-maintained system roots.

Adding a moss-format repository is as simple as registering a new location from where to fetch
`stone.index` files, which will be shown in detail later on this page.

### `moss` build roots

Every time a package is built, `boulder` calls out to `moss` to have it construct a pristine build root
directory (called a 'buildroot') with the necessary package build prerequisites installed.

The packages in this buildroot are resolved from one or more moss `stone.index` files, sorted in
descending priority, such that the highest priority repository "wins" when package providers are
resolved.

The lowest priority repository will typically be the official AerynOS upstream package
repository.

If higher priority repositories are added, packages from these will in turn override the packages
available in the official AerynOS upstream package repository.

The next section deals with how to create and register a higher priority local moss-format
repository, which is colloquially referred to as a "local repo".


## Creating a local repository

After the helper script has been activated in `bash`, open a new tab or a new terminal, and execute
the following commands:

```bash
# create a new tab or open a new terminal
gotoaosrepo
just create-local
just index-local
```

The `just create-local` invocation will set up an empty `~/.cache/local_repo/x86_64/` directory,
and the `just index-local` invocation will create a `stone.index` file for the directory.


### Making boulder use the local repository

Boulder will need to have its list of "build profiles" be updated before it will consult the
`~/.cache/local_repo/x86_64/stone.index` moss-format repository index created above:

```bash
boulder profile list
# output
default-x86_64:
  - volatile = https://packages.aerynos.com/volatile/x86_64/stone.index [0]

# add new local-x86_64 build profile
boulder profile add \
  --repo name=volatile,uri=https://packages.aerynos.com/volatile/x86_64/stone.index,priority=0 \
  --repo name=local,uri=file://${HOME}/.cache/local_repo/x86_64/stone.index,priority=100 \
  local-x86_64
boulder profile list
# output
default-x86_64:
 - volatile = https://packages.aerynos.com/volatile/x86_64/stone.index [0]
local-x86_64:
 - volatile = https://packages.aerynos.com/volatile/x86_64/stone.index [0]
 - local = file:///home/ermo/.cache/local_repo/x86_64/stone.index [100]
```

Behind the scenes, `boulder` builds and saves an appropriately named build profile to `~/.config/boulder/profile.d/`.

This is what `local-x86_64.yaml` should look like after the above commands have been run successfully:

```yaml
local-x86_64:
  repositories:
    local:
      description: ''
      uri: file:///home/ermo/.cache/local_repo/x86_64/stone.index
      priority: 100
      active: true
    volatile:
      description: ''
      uri: https://packages.aerynos.com/volatile/x86_64/stone.index
      priority: 0
      active: true
```


### Making `moss` use the local repository

Listing and adding moss-format repositories containing stone.index files is done as follows:


```bash
moss repo list
# output
 - unstable = https://aerynos.dev/volatile/x86_64/stone.index [0]
# add repositories
sudo moss repo add volatile https://packages.aerynos.com/volatile/x86_64/stone.index -p 10
sudo moss repo add local file://${HOME}/.cache/local_repo/x86_64/stone.index -p 100
moss repo list
# output
 - unstable = https://aerynos.dev/volatile/x86_64/stone.index [0]
 - volatile = https://packages.aerynos.com/volatile/x86_64/stone.index [10]
 - local = file:///home/ermo/.cache/local_repo/x86_64/stone.index [100]
```


#### Package resolution order

In the above priority tower, each moss-format package would first get resolved via the `local`
repository (priority 100), then from the `volatile` repository (priority 10), and finally from the
`unstable` repository (priority 0), the latter of which is the official upstream AerynOS
moss-format `.stone` package repository.


#### Disabling moss-format repositories

Users of AerynOS should generally _not_ have the `volatile` repository be enabled, because this
repository is where new `.stone` packages land right after being built, which means the repository
can potentially be in an undefined and volatile state when building large build queues (hence the
name).

Therefore, it can be useful to disable moss-format repositories without deleting their definitions
from the local system:

```bash
sudo moss repo disable volatile 
sudo moss repo disable local
moss repo list
# output
 - unstable = https://aerynos.dev/volatile/x86_64/stone.index [0]
 - volatile = https://packages.aerynos.com/volatile/x86_64/stone.index [10] (disabled)
 - local = file:///home/ermo/.cache/local_repo/x86_64/stone.index [100] (disabled)
```


#### Enabling moss-format repositories

However, when testing locally built packages, they _must_ be built against the `local-x86_64`
boulder build profile, which in turns relies on the `volatile` repository via the boulder
`local-x86_64` build profile.

Hence, when testing locally built packages, you may need to _**temporarily**_ enable the `volatile`
repository for moss to resolve from.

```bash
sudo moss repo enable volatile 
sudo moss repo enable local
moss repo list
# output
 - unstable = https://aerynos.dev/volatile/x86_64/stone.index [0]
 - volatile = https://packages.aerynos.com/volatile/x86_64/stone.index [10]
 - local = file:///home/ermo/.cache/local_repo/x86_64/stone.index [100]
```


## Building recipes using the `local-x86_64` profile

To actually build a recipe, it is recommended that new packagers start out by building `nano`.

```bash
# Go into the root of the AerynOS recipe directory 
gotoaosrepo
# change to the directory holding the nano recipe
chpkg nano
# bump the release number in the nano recipe
just bump
# check the difference between the local state and the upstream recipe state
git diff
# build the bumped nano recipe
just build
# check the difference between the local state and the upstream recipe state
git status
# move the newly built .stone build artifacts to the local repository
just mv-local
# list the build artifacts present in the local repository
just ls-local
```

Note that the basic packaging workflow in AerynOS assumes that you are using a local repository.

If you are building multiple package recipes, you will need to `just build` and `just mv-local`
for each package recipe sequentially.


## Updating the installed system state

Testing your package(s) is now as simple as:

- Enabling (or disabling) the relevant moss-format repositories with:
  ```bash
  sudo moss repo enable/disable <the repository>
  ```
- Updating moss' view of the enabled moss-format repository indices with:
  ```bash
  sudo moss sync -u
  ```


## Cleaning the local repository

Often, it will be prudent to clean out the local repository after the associated recipe PR has been
accepted upstream.

```bash
gotoaosrepo
just clean-local
sudo moss repo disable volatile
sudo moss repo disable local
sudo moss sync -u 
```

This will sync the the local system to a new installed system state made only from the upstream
`unstable` moss-format `.stone` package repository state.

This will effectively make the new system state "forget" the nano version installed from the local
repository in the previous system state.

## Ending notes

If you have made it this far, congratulations! You should now understand the basic workflow of
packaging and managing repositories with AerynOS.

Tip: execute `just -l` to see a list of supported `just` 'recipes', which are common actions that
     have been automated by the AerynOS developers.
