description: "Stateless management of AerynOS user accounts"

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

As a stateless distribution, AerynOS does not permit the modification of `/etc/passwd` and co by
packages or triggers. Instead, we integrate `nss-systemd` and `userdb`.

<Aside type="caution">

  The use of `nss` means that user accounts and groups defined by this mechanism are only available
  to packages using the correct `glibc` APIs. Statically linking with `musl` or directly reading
  `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, etc, will not reveal these accounts.

</Aside>

The main benefit with this approach is ensuring that we do not directly mutate system files, and that
unlike the `sysusers` mechanism, removal of a package ensures these system user and group definitions
are no longer available.
