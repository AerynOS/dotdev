description: Create and maintain monitoring.yaml so release automation and security alerts stay accurate.
---

Every recipe should ship a `monitoring.yaml` so our tooling can watch for upstream releases and security issues. Use this reference to populate the file consistently and to find the data required for each field.

## File layout

A minimal monitoring file includes release tracking and optional security metadata:

```yaml
releases:
  id: 00000
  rss: https://example.com/project/releases.atom
security:
  cpe:
    - vendor: example
      product: project
```

Indent with two spaces and keep related comments inline so CI and reviewers can follow your reasoning.

## Release tracking

`releases.id`
: Numeric identifier from [release-monitoring.org](https://release-monitoring.org) (Anitya). Look up the upstream project and note the number in the URL, for example `https://release-monitoring.org/project/300958` for Python.

`releases.rss`
: URL to an Atom/RSS feed for new releases. Use `~` if no feed exists.

### Common feed patterns

- **GitHub**: `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases.atom` or `.../tags.atom`
- **GitLab / KDE Invent**: append `/-/tags?format=atom` to the project URL, for example `https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/tags?format=atom`
- **PyPI**: no feed is required; prefer `~` and rely on the Anitya ID
- **Freedesktop GitLab**: `https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/<path>/-/tags?format=atom`
- **Custom sites**: many upstreams publish a `releases.xml`/`atom.xml` file; link directly when available

### Ignore patterns

Use `releases.ignore` to skip versions our repo does not track. Provide a short comment and regular expressions that match the releases to drop.

```yaml
releases:
  id: 320206
  ignore:
    # Qt 6 builds are out of scope for qt5 packages
    - ^6\.
  rss: ~
```

Prefer anchored expressions (`^` / `$`) to avoid false positives.

 For reference, `^` means "begins with", while `$` means "ends with".
 
## Security metadata

`security.cpe`
: List of Common Platform Enumeration entries to watch in the NVD feed. Search [nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe) for vendor and product strings. Add every applicable CPE when upstream ships multiple identifiers.

`security.ignore`
: Optional list of CVE IDs or regexes our package should ignore (for example, CVEs that only affect optional components).

If no CPE exists, set the value to `~` and add a dated comment noting the last time you checked.

```yaml
security:
  cpe: ~
  # No known CPE as of 2024-09-01
```

## Where to find the data

1. **Start with release-monitoring.org**: search for the upstream name. 
2. **Collect feeds**: confirm the `releases.atom` or `/-/tags?format=atom` URL opens in a browser. Use curl or `wget -qO- <feed>` locally when you need to double-check.
3. **Identify CPE strings**: search the NVD catalog or reuse values from similar recipes. Many projects share vendor IDs (for example, both upstream `python` and the `urllib3` package provide CPEs).
4. **Document exceptions**: add comments whenever you set `ignore` patterns or leave fields empty so future maintainers understand the decision.

## Example templates

### GitHub project with security feed

```yaml
releases:
  id: 4078
  rss: https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/releases.atom
security:
  cpe:
    - vendor: urllib3
      product: urllib3
    - vendor: python
      product: urllib3
```

### GitLab project with prerelease filter

```yaml
releases:
  id: 5440
  ignore:
    # Track the current stable branch only
    - 258.*
  rss: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/-/tags?format=atom
security:
  cpe:
    - vendor: systemd_project
      product: systemd
```

### No CPE available

```yaml
releases:
  id: 19755
  rss: ~
security:
  cpe: ~
  # No CPE published as of 2023-03-23
```

Keep monitoring files in sync with upstream changes. When a project moves or renames releases, update the ID and feed so our automated tooling continues to work.
